    "One of the initial concepts introduced to scientists in the field of statistics is the existence of two distinct methodologies: frequentism and Bayesianism. The core of the debate between frequentists and Bayesians lies in their differing interpretations of what probability signifies. In our big data class, the majority of the topics will be centered around the frequentist approach. However, time permitting, we might delve into Bayesian methodologies, such as Bayesian Vector Autoregression (B-VAR).\n",

    "### Basics of Bayesian Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as a quick reveiw, Bayesian statistics is a subset of statistics in which probability expresses a degree of belief in an event. This belief may change as new evidence is presented. Bayesian statistics uses Bayes' Theorem to update the probabilities of hypotheses as more evidence or information becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem provides a way to update our probability estimates for hypotheses as we gain new evidence. It is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\times P(A)}{P(B)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $P(A|B)$ is the **posterior probability**: The probability of event A occurring given that B is true.\n",
    "- $P(B|A)$ is the **likelihood**: The probability of observing event B given A is true.\n",
    "- $P(A)$ is the **prior probability**: The initial probability of event A before observing B.\n",
    "- $P(B)$ is the **evidence**: The total probability of observing event B under all possible conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relation to Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. Bayes' Theorem uses conditional probability to reverse the conditionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "- From $P(B|A)$, the probability of B given A, we can compute $P(A|B)$, the probability of A given B, by incorporating our prior belief about A ($P(A)$) and normalizing by the evidence ($P(B)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of hypotheses (A) in light of new evidence (B).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian statistics is about updating our beliefs with evidence:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a prior belief (`P(A)`), which is our initial assumption about the probability of an hypothesis.\n",
    "2. Collect evidence and calculate the likelihood (`P(B|A)`).\n",
    "3. Use Bayes' Theorem to update the prior belief into a posterior belief (`P(A|B)`), which takes into account the new evidence.\n",
    "4. The posterior belief becomes the new prior if more evidence is to be considered, repeating the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian statistics is particularly powerful in situations where information is updated or accumulated over time, allowing for dynamic adjustments to predictions and hypotheses.\n"

    "**Model fitting** proceeds by assuming a particular model is true, and tuning the model so it provides the best possible fit to the data. **Model selection** (which includes *model comparison*, and *model evaluation*) , on the other hand, asks the larger question of whether the assumptions of the model are compatible with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make this more concrete.\n",
    "By *model* here I essentially mean a formula, usually with tunable parameters, which quantifies the likelihood of observing your data.\n",
    "For example, your model might consist of the statement, \"the $(x, y)$ observations come from a straight line, with known normal measurement errors $\\sigma_y$\".\n",
    "Labeling this model $M_1$, we can write:\n",
    "\n",

    "There are two tunable parameters to this model, represented by the vector $\\theta = [\\theta_0, \\theta_1]$ (i.e. the slope and intercept).\n",

    "Another model might consist of the statement \"the observations $(x, y)$ come from a quadratic curve, with known normal measurement errors $\\sigma_y$\".\n",
    "Labeling this model $M_2$, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_{M_2}(x;\\theta) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x + \\theta_2 x^2\\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three tunable parameters here, again represented by the vector $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model fitting, in this case, is the process of finding constraints on the values of the parameters $\\theta$ within each model.\n",
    "That is, it allows you to make statements such as, \"assuming $M_1$ is true, this particular $\\theta$ gives the best-fit line\" or \"assuming $M_2$ is true, this particular vector $\\theta$ gives the best-fit curve.\"\n",
    "Model fitting proceeds without respect to whether the model is capable of describing the data well; it just arrives at the best-fit model *under the assumption that the model is accurate*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Model selection, on the other hand, is not concerned with the parameters themselves, but with the question of whether the model is capable of describing the data well.\n",

    "#### The AIC\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to model selection is to use an information-theoretic criterion to identify the most appropriate model. Akaike (1973) found a formal relationship between Kullback-Leibler information (a dominant paradigm in information and coding theory) and likelihood theory. Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) is an estimator of expected relative K-L information based on the maximized log-likelihood function, corrected for asymptotic bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<center> AIC(model) = -2  $\\cdot$ log-likelihood(model) + 2 $\\cdot$ (length of the parameter space)</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{AIC} = −2 \\log(L(\\theta|data)) + 2p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "AIC balances the fit of the model (in terms of the likelihood) with the number of parameters required to achieve that fit. We can easily calculate AIC from the residual sums of squares as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{AIC} = n \\log(\\text{RSS}/n) + 2p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p$ is the number of parameters in the model. Notice that as the number of parameters increase, the residual sum of squares goes down, but the second term (a penalty) increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply AIC to a model selection problem, we choose the model that has the lowest AIC value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AIC is generally used to compare each candidate model. The nice thing about the AIC is that for every model that uses Maximum Likelihood Estimation, the log-likelihood is automatically computed, and as a consequence the AIC is very easy to calculate.\n",
    "The AIC acts as a penalised log-likelihood criterion, giving a balance between a good fit (high value of log-likelihood) and complexity (complex models are penalized more than fairly simple ones). The AIC is unbounded so can take any type of value, but the bottom line is that when comparing models, the model with the lowest AIC should be selected.\n",
    "Note that directly comparing the values of log-likelihood maxima for different models (without including the penalty) is not good enough for model comparison, because including more parameters in a model will always give rise to an increased value of the maximum likelihood. Because of that reason, searching for the model with maximal log-likelihood would always lead to the model with the most parameters. The AIC balances this by penalizing for number of parameters, hence searching for models with few parameters but fitting the data well. data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "> It makes rather stringent assumptions about the form of the likelihood, and so cannot be universally applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The BIC\n",
    "\n",
    "The BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) is very similar to the AIC and emerged as a Bayesian response to the AIC, but can be used for the exact same purposes. The idea is to select the candidate model with the highest probability given the data. This idea can be formalised inside a Bayesian framework, involving prior probabilities on candidate models along with prior densities on all parameters in the models. The penalty is slightly changed and depends on the number of rows to the data set:\n",

    "> So is there a better approach to feature selection? **Cross-validation.** It provides a more reliable estimate of out-of-sample error, and thus is a better way to choose which of your models will best **generalize** to out-of-sample data. Importantly, cross-validation can be applied to any model, whereas the methods described above only apply to linear models."
