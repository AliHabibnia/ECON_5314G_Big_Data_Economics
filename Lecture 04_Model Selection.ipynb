    "This notebook explores model selection techniques within the frequentist framework, emphasizing metrics such as AIC, BIC, and adjusted \\(R^2\\) to compare competing models post-estimation. We also discuss the philosophical differences between frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and contrast the traditional statistical focus on in-sample goodness-of-fit and parameter significance with the machine learning emphasis on out-of-sample prediction accuracy via cross-validation.\n",

    "### Basics of Bayesian Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as a quick reveiw, Bayesian statistics is a subset of statistics in which probability expresses a degree of belief in an event. This belief may change as new evidence is presented. Bayesian statistics uses Bayes' Theorem to update the probabilities of hypotheses as more evidence or information becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of Bayesian inference is Bayes' Theorem, which provides a principled way to update our probability estimates for hypotheses in light of new data. The theorem is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\times P(A)}{P(B)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $P(A|B)$ is the **posterior probability**: The updated probability of event A (hypothesis) occurring given that event B (evidence) is true.\n",
    "- $P(B|A)$ is the **likelihood**: The probability of observing event B given A is true.\n",
    "- $P(A)$ is the **prior probability**: The initial belief about the probability of event A before observing B.\n",
    "- $P(B)$ is the **evidence or marginal likelihood**: The total probability of observing event B under all possible conditions. It serves as a normalizing constant to ensure that the posterior probabilities sum to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relation to Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional probability measures the likelihood of an event given that another event has occurred. Bayes' Theorem leverages this concept by \"reversing\" the conditioning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- From $P(B|A)$, the probability of B given A, we can compute $P(A|B)$, the probability of A given B, by incorporating our prior belief about A ($P(A)$) and normalizing by the evidence ($P(B)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "This inversion is fundamental to Bayesian updating, enabling us to reassess the plausibility of a hypothesis in the light of new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of Bayesian updating can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a prior belief (`P(A)`), which is our initial assumption or knowledge about the probability of an hypothesis.\n",
    "2. Collect evidence and calculate the likelihood (`P(B|A)`), which quantifies how probable the observed data is under the hypothesis.\n",
    "3. Use Bayes' Theorem to update the prior belief into a posterior belief (`P(A|B)`), which takes into account the new evidence.\n",
    "4. The posterior belief becomes the new prior if more evidence is to be considered, iterating the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian statistics is particularly powerful in situations where information is updated or accumulated over time, allowing for dynamic adjustments to predictions and hypotheses.\n"

    "AIC balances the fit of the model (in terms of the likelihood) with the number of parameters required to achieve that fit. We can easily calculate AIC from the residual sums of squares as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{AIC} = n \\log(\\text{RSS}/n) + 2p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p$ is the number of parameters in the model. Notice that as the number of parameters increase, the residual sum of squares goes down, but the second term (a penalty) increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply AIC to a model selection problem, we choose the model that has the lowest AIC value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AIC is generally used to compare each candidate model. The nice thing about the AIC is that for every model that uses Maximum Likelihood Estimation, the log-likelihood is automatically computed, and as a consequence the AIC is very easy to calculate.\n",
    "The AIC acts as a penalised log-likelihood criterion, giving a balance between a good fit (high value of log-likelihood) and complexity (complex models are penalized more than fairly simple ones). The AIC is unbounded so can take any type of value, but the bottom line is that when comparing models, the model with the lowest AIC should be selected.\n",
    "Note that directly comparing the values of log-likelihood maxima for different models (without including the penalty) is not good enough for model comparison, because including more parameters in a model will always give rise to an increased value of the maximum likelihood. Because of that reason, searching for the model with maximal log-likelihood would always lead to the model with the most parameters. The AIC balances this by penalizing for number of parameters, hence searching for models with few parameters but fitting the data well. data well.\n",

    "> It makes rather stringent assumptions about the form of the likelihood, and so cannot be universally applied.\n",

    "#### The BIC\n",
    "\n",
    "The BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) is very similar to the AIC and emerged as a Bayesian response to the AIC, but can be used for the exact same purposes. The idea is to select the candidate model with the highest probability given the data. This idea can be formalised inside a Bayesian framework, involving prior probabilities on candidate models along with prior densities on all parameters in the models. The penalty is slightly changed and depends on the number of rows to the data set:\n",

    "### Cross-Validation: A Machine Learning Approach to Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to frequentist model selection criteria such as AIC and BIC, which focus on balancing goodness-of-fit and complexity, **cross-validation (CV)** is a widely used approach in machine learning that directly assesses the model's **out-of-sample predictive performance**. Cross-validation is particularly useful when the goal is to **select the model that generalizes best to new, unseen data** rather than simply fitting the observed data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Cross-Validation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation is a **resampling technique** that partitions the dataset into multiple subsets (or \"folds\") to evaluate a model's performance on different segments of the data. The most commonly used method is **\\( k \\)-fold cross-validation**, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The dataset is randomly split into \\( k \\) equally sized subsets (folds).\n",
    "2. The model is trained (estimated) on \\( k-1 \\) folds and tested (evaluated) on the remaining fold.\n",
    "3. This process is repeated \\( k \\) times, with each fold serving as the test set once.\n",
    "4. The final performance score is obtained by averaging the results across all folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method ensures that every observation is used for both training and testing, reducing bias and variance in performance estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Cross-Validation for Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike AIC or BIC, which evaluate models based on likelihood functions and penalize complexity, cross-validation directly measures **how well the model predicts unseen data**. The model with the lowest cross-validation error is considered the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we apply **\\( k \\)-fold cross-validation** to find the optimal polynomial degree for the regression model.\n",

    "### Discussion: Selecting the Best Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model with the **lowest cross-validation error** is preferred since it generalizes best to unseen data.\n",
    "- Unlike AIC/BIC, which rely on likelihood-based penalization, cross-validation directly measures predictive accuracy.\n",
    "- If the cross-validation error increases after a certain polynomial degree, it indicates **overfitting**, meaning the model captures noise rather than signal.\n",
    "- If the error is high for low-degree polynomials, it suggests **underfitting**, meaning the model is too simple to capture the data’s structure.\n",

    "- If the goal is **inference**, frequentist criteria (AIC, BIC, adjusted \\(R^2\\)) are more suitable since they balance goodness-of-fit and complexity.\n",
    "- If the goal is **prediction**, cross-validation is preferable because it selects the model with the best **out-of-sample** performance.\n",
    "- In practice, combining **both approaches** can lead to more robust model selection.\n",

    "By applying these techniques, we can make informed decisions about model complexity, avoiding both **underfitting** and **overfitting** while ensuring strong predictive power.\n"
