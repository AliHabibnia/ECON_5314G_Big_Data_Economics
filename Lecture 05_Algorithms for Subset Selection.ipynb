    "## Forward Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward selection** is a stepwise approach that starts with no variables in the model (the null model) and adds them one by one. In the first step, it adds the most significant variable. At each subsequent step, it adds the most significant variable of those not in the model, until there are no variables that meet the criterion set by the researcher.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Start with a model containing only the constant term (intercept).\n",
    "2. For each variable not in the model:\n",
    "   - Compute the decrease in SSR (Sum of Squares of the Residuals) that would result from adding the variable.\n",
    "   - Estimate $\\hat{\\sigma}^2$ for the current model.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backward Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backward elimination** is the reverse process of forward selection. We start with all candidate variables (full model) and remove the least significant variable at each step, until none meet the criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm:\n",
    "1. Start with all variables in the model.\n",
    "2. For each variable in the model:\n",
    "   - Compute the increase in SSR that would result from removing the variable.\n",

    "## Stepwise Regression\n",

    "**Stepwise regression** alternates between forward and backward, bringing in and removing variables that meet the criteria for entry or removal, until a stable set of variables is attained. This procedure is like Forward Selection except that at each step we consider dropping variables as in Backward Elimination.\n",

    "1. Start with no variables in the model or all variables, depending on the specific type of stepwise regression.\n",
    "2. Perform steps from forward selection to add significant variables.\n",
    "3. Perform steps from backward elimination to remove non-significant variables.\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until adding or removing variables does not improve the model.\n",

    "- Convergence is guaranteed if the thresholds $F_{out}$ and $F_{in}$ satisfy: $F_{out}$ < $F_{in}$. It is possible, however, for a variable to enter $S$ and then leave $S$ at a subsequent step and even rejoin $S$ at a yet later step.\n",
