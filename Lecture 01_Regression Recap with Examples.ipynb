    "All finance students should have some knowledge of one of the most important topics in finance, that is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets, particularly stocks. CAPM is widely used throughout finance for pricing risky securities and generating expected returns for assets given the risk of those assets and cost of capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for calculating the expected return of an asset given its risk is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $ r_i = r_f + \\beta_i (r_m − r_f)$\n",

    "\n",
    "$r_f$: The return of the risk-free asset. The risk-free asset is usually given by the US 3-month Treasury bill. It is assumed that the US government will not default on a short-term government security, thus the US 3-month Treasury bill is widely assumed in finance to be risk-free. \n",
    "\n",
    "$r_m$ : The return of the market. This is usually given by the S&P500 return as it is the largest market index in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "$(r_m − r_f)$ : Market risk premium\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Investors expect to be compensated for risk and the time value of money. The risk-free rate in the CAPM formula accounts for the time value of money. The other components of the CAPM formula account for the investor taking on additional risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beta of a potential investment is a measure of how much risk the investment will add to a portfolio that looks like the market. If a stock is riskier than the market, it will have a beta greater than one. If a stock has a beta of less than one, the formula assumes it will reduce the risk of a portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "A beta coefficient can measure the volatility of an individual stock compared to the systematic risk of the entire market. In statistical terms, beta represents the slope of the line through a regression of data points. In finance, each of these data points represents an individual stock's returns against those of the market as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "A stock’s beta is then multiplied by the market risk premium, which is the return expected from the market above the risk-free rate. The risk-free rate is then added to the product of the stock’s beta and the market risk premium. The result should give an investor the required return or discount rate they can use to find the value of an asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the CAPM formula is to evaluate whether a stock is fairly valued when its risk and the time value of money are compared to its expected return.\n"

This model considers the fact that value and small-cap stocks outperform markets on a regular basis. By including these two additional factors, the model adjusts for this outperforming tendency, which is thought to make it a better tool for evaluating manager performance. The model is essentially the result of an econometric regression of historical stock prices.\n",
