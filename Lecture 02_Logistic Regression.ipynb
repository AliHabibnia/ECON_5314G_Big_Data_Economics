    "The odds might be 3:2 which means p = 0.6 and 1-p = 0.4. Here p is greater and 1-p is smaller.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$Odds Ratio (OR) = \\frac {p}{1-p}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If OddsRatio is high say:  \n",
    "\n",

    "then the event might be considered very likely and if:  \n",

    "\n",
    "then very unlikely.  \n",

    "### The Logit Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematicians like to work with a function derived from this called the Logit function. It's the Log of the OddsRatio\n",
    "\n",
    "$$logit(p) = log(\\frac{p}{1-p})$$  \n",

    "As you might recognize, the right side of the (immediate) equation above depicts the linear combination of independent variables. The left side is known as the log - odds or odds ratio or logit function and is the link function for Logistic Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can interpret the above equation as, a unit increase in variable $x$ results in multiplying the odds ratio by $exp$ to power $\\beta$. In other words, the regression coefficients explain the change in log(odds) in the response for a unit change in predictor. However, since the relationship between $p(X)$ and $X$ is not straight line, a unit change in input feature doesn't really affect the model output directly but it affects the odds ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we would say:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$logit(p) = log( \\frac{p}{1-p} ) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X$$  \n",

    "where $X$ is the \"value\" of the event.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So here instead of $Y = \\beta_0 + b_1X$ we want to plot $logit(p)$ on the $Y$ axis and the event or the score on the $X$ axis.  \n",

    "So this is how the linear model slips in - we want to express log odds as a linear function of score.  \n",
