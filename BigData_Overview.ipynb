    "## DATA COLLECTION: FROM SURVEYS TO SATELLITES AND SENSORS\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Traditionally, economists have relied on surveys and national account estimates to assess the impact of policy interventions. Conducting surveys is time-intensive, costly, and prone to error. In many countries, notably in the poorest countries and fragile states survey data is simply unavailable or the quality is in doubt.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Big data from satellites, mobile phones, and social media, among other tools, allows researchers to build on, and in some cases, replace traditional methods of acquiring socioeconomic data. \n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Its advantages are frequency and near-real-time data, accuracy and objectiveness. Its disadvantages are the fact that the indicators available are merely proxies for what policymakers are interested in and need for policy design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Social scientists have started to use nighttime light measures, or luminosity, as proxies for economic activity and population distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/satt.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Mobile phone data can also be used to infer socioeconomic characteristics in a geographically disaggregated way.  Cell phones can provide data on: (i) mobility, (ii) social interactions, and (iii) consumption and expenditure patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Digital footprints from social media can also fill gaps in data for policymakers and development practitioners. For example, Google Trends (GT) reports, which provide real-time information on search queries at state and metro levels for several countries, have informed private consumption predictions.\n",

    "We don't get to observe the world under these alternative policies, so we can't simply find the answers in the data. Knowing the counterfactual requires being able to measure a causal effect. Being able to measure a causal effect requires making assumptions. That's what economics is all about!\n",

    "\n",
    "* #### In contrast, the goal of machine learning is to come up with the best possible out-of-sample prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "* #### We refer to this as the primary concern of machine learning being \"y hat\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### The goal is to make sure that the best prediction is had by tuning and validating many different kinds of models. This is what cross-validation is all about, and it is what machine learning practitioners obsess about."
